# Microservices Architecture Projects

This repository contains all of my projects related to microservices architecture, including both class assignments and personal projects.

## Contents

- **Class Projects**
### Project 1: Implementing a Singly Linked List
This project involves creating a singly linked list data structure from scratch. 
The singly linked list will support basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. 
The goal of this project is to understand the fundamentals of linked lists and how they can be used to manage collections of data.

### Project 2: Implementing a Doubly Linked List
This project focuses on implementing a doubly linked list data structure. 
Unlike the singly linked list, each node in a doubly linked list contains references to both the next and previous nodes. 
This allows for more efficient bidirectional traversal and manipulation of the list. 
The project will cover operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal in both directions.
