### Project 1: Design & Implement an SQL database for a bank.
The database will store detailed information about customers, including their name, location, age, salary, and contact details. 
Each customer will have one or more bank accounts, which could be checking, savings, or loan accounts, each with different interest rates. 
The database will also support an online banking feature where customers can log in to view their transactions and history.
